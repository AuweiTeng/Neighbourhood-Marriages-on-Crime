Neighbourhood Effects of Marriages on Crime

This is for the GY460 project. This is for replication purposes, not for plagiarism.

The SpaitalMatrix.ipynb contains all the data processing. Please download the data yourself at Nomis https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ and UK Police Data https://data.police.uk/ and change the directories that are specified. 

The clustering is done on a city level, which is available from https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/589ae01495bf4ddfaaa25b96476d53d7

The aggregate.py contains the functions to aggregate police data by year. 

I will also attach the paper onto github after submission deadline.

For collaboration, please reach out to me @ h.teng1@lse.ac.uk
